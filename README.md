Mental-Health-Prediction-Using-ML-Algorithms     

This project aims to predict mental health issues using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to develop models that can accurately identify individuals who may be at risk of mental health problems based on provided data.





Project Description

Mental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being, and early identification of potential mental health issues can lead to timely intervention and support. In this project, we explore the application of machine learning algorithms to predict mental health conditions. The dataset used contains various features related to demographics, lifestyle, and other relevant factors.


**Key Features**

**.** Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

**.** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data distribution, relationships, and key insights through visualizations.

**.** Model Building: Implementing multiple machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and more.

**.** Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

**.** Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance through techniques such as grid search and random search.
